# Verifying Your Auto-Deployment Setup

This document explains how to verify that your auto-deployment setup between GitHub and Hostinger is working correctly.

## What We've Set Up

1. Added a webhook to your GitHub repository that calls Hostinger's deployment URL
2. Created a webhook-test.js script that displays deployment timestamps
3. Modified index.html to include this script

## How to Verify the Webhook Is Working

### Step 1: Check if the Webhook Was Added Successfully

1. Go to `https://github.com/UmeshCode1/indo-american-Play-School/settings/hooks`
2. You should see a webhook pointing to `https://webhooks.hostinger.com/deploy/a09f3dda408e91f74332abea9181c5f0`
3. It should have a green checkmark indicating successful delivery

### Step 2: Make a Test Change

1. Edit the webhook-test.js file in your repository
2. Update the "Last webhook test" comment with the current date and time
3. Commit and push the change to the master branch

```bash
# Example PowerShell command:
cd "path\to\repo"
# Edit js/webhook-test.js
git add js/webhook-test.js
git commit -m "Test webhook deployment"
git push origin master
```

### Step 3: Verify the Deployment

1. Wait a few minutes for the deployment to complete (typically 1-5 minutes)
2. Visit your website and open the browser's developer console (F12 or right-click → Inspect → Console)
3. You should see a message "Webhook test script loaded at: [current time]"
4. If you see this message with the updated timestamp, the auto-deployment is working!

### Step 4: Additional Verification Methods

#### Check Deployment History in Hostinger

1. Log in to your Hostinger control panel
2. Navigate to the Websites section
3. Select your website
4. Look for a "Deployment History" or "Git Deployments" section
5. You should see your recent deployment listed there

#### Check for the Hidden Element

The webhook-test.js script adds a hidden element to your page with the deployment timestamp:

```javascript
// In your browser console, run:
document.getElementById('auto-deploy-timestamp').dataset.deployTime
```

This should return the timestamp of the most recent deployment.

## Troubleshooting

If the auto-deployment isn't working:

1. **Check GitHub Webhook Delivery Status**:
   - Go to your webhook settings in GitHub
   - Click on the webhook
   - Scroll down to "Recent Deliveries"
   - Check if there are any failed deliveries and review the error messages

2. **Verify Hostinger's Webhook Configuration**:
   - Log in to Hostinger control panel
   - Check if there are any specific settings for the webhook
   - Make sure the correct branch (master) is configured for deployment

3. **Manual Deployment**:
   - If automatic deployment fails, you can try a manual deployment from Hostinger's control panel
   - This can help determine if the issue is with the webhook or with the deployment process itself

4. **Contact Hostinger Support**:
   - If you've verified your settings and the webhook still isn't working, contact Hostinger support
   - They can provide specific guidance for your hosting plan

## Best Practices

- Make small, incremental changes when testing deployments
- Keep the deployment.md file updated with deployment notes
- Consider setting up a staging environment for testing changes before deploying to production
