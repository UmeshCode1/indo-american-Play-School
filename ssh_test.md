# SSH Authentication Test

This file was created to test the SSH authentication between the local repository and GitHub.

## Test Information

- **Date**: May 27, 2025
- **Purpose**: Verify SSH key authentication
- **Key**: Hostinger deployment SSH key
- **Server**: in-mum-web1856.main-hosting.eu

## Next Steps

If this file successfully appears in the GitHub repository, the SSH key has been correctly added and the remote URL has been properly configured.

Now you can:

1. Continue using SSH for all Git operations (no password required)
2. Use the webhook auto-deployment setup to automatically deploy changes
3. Make website updates with a streamlined workflow

The combination of SSH authentication and webhook-based auto-deployment creates a fully automated system for updating your website.
